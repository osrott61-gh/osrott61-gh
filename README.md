## about me

* currently working on **lineageos 23.0** for various devices
* building **extremerom-kebab** for oneui 8 (private)
* passionate about open-source android development
* growing and maintaining my own homelab since january 2025

outside of tech, i'm heavily interested in **cars and bikes**, especially older vehicles. some of my favorite cars include the mercedes w123 and w126, audi a8 d2 and audi 80, and bmws like the e38 and e30. i also own a lowered and modified **opel astra g**, and enjoy learning about mechanics and tuning.

i'm also into bikes because my dad used to own a motorcycle repair shop and was active in racing until 2014. growing up around that environment got me into motorsports early on.

besides all that, i'm the **stage technician at my school**, handling lighting and tech for performances and events (sometimes until way too late — record was 3am).
