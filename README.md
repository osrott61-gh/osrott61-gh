## ðŸš€ What I'm Currently Building & Exploring

- Contributing to LineageOS 22.2 for the Exynos 990.
- Learning about homelab setups and infrastructure.  
- Working on my personal homelab, featuring:  

  - **Dell R730**: 1x Xeon E5-2690V4 (have some better ones floating around, but no thermal paste), 96GB DDR4 2133MT/s LRDIMM (genuine Dell), 1TB NVMe, 256GB NVMe, 2x 512GB SATA SSD, 3x 8TB HDDs for archiving.  
  - **Dell OptiPlex 5060 Micro**: Intel Pentium Gold G5500T, 16GB RAM, 256GB NVMe, 3x 1TB HDD (1x SATA, 2x USB3), runs my homelab services like reverse proxies, status pages, backups and Ubuntu Cockpit.  
  - **Dell Precision 3620**: i7-7700K, 64GB DDR4, 512GB NVMe, GTX 1080. My main rig for development and hosting a Minecraft server.
  - **Generic office PC**: i7-4790, 16GB DDR3, 2x 256GB SSD (R1). Currently doing absolutely nothing
  - **Dell Wyse 3040**: Intel Atom x5-Z8350, 2GB RAM, 8GB eMMC. My VPN server.  
  - **Dell Precision 7820**: i7-7820HQ, 40GB DDR4, Quadro M2200. Manages all of the above.  

(Yes, I'm a Dell enthusiast!)

Besides all that technical stuff, I'm also the stage technician at my school, which is funâ€”as long as I don't have to stay until 8 PM (or even longer, record was 3AM this october, which happens quite often. This includes lighting bigger performances for 8th or 11th graders or more random events like celebrations at short notice.
