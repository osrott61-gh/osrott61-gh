## major update: stepping back

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-inactive-red?style=for-the-badge)

as of january 2026, i have officially left telegram and will not be returning.

**this marks the end of my active contributions to tech.**

1.  **android:** all my android-related projects (including extremerom) are permanently discontinued. i will not be building or maintaining anything moving forward.
2.  **homelab:** i have also stopped homelabbing entirely and sold my equipment. i am no longer maintaining any servers or self-hosted services. some sites may stay alive, but with no guarantee staying forever, as I cancelled all subscriptions for clouflare and so on.

farewell, and thanks for the ride.

## about me

since stepping away from digital projects, i'm focusing on the real world.

i'm heavily interested in **cars and bikes**, especially older vehicles. some of my favorite cars include the mercedes w123 and w126, audi a8 d2 and audi 80, and bmws like the e38 and e30. i also own a lowered and modified **opel astra g**, and enjoy learning about mechanics and tuning.

i'm also into bikes because my dad used to own a motorcycle repair shop and was active in racing until 2014. growing up around that environment got me into motorsports early on.

besides all that, i'm the **stage technician at my school**, handling lighting and tech for performances and events (sometimes until way too late — record was 3am).
